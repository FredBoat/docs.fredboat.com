# Welcome to FredBoat Docs
Welcome to the FredBoat docs. FredBoat is an open-source general-purpose bot developed in Java. The bot is based off of [JDA](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA) and was created by [@Frederikam](https://github.com/Frederikam/).

Additionally I am also developing FredBoat♪♪ and is a music bot. This is a seperate bot and must therefore be invited using [this link](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=184405253028970496&scope=bot). See the commands below on how to use it.

## Setting up the bot
Getting FredBoat running on your server is simple. You can invite the bot by authenticating it with your account using [this](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=168686772216135681&scope=bot) link. Bear in mind that you must have `Manage Server` permissions to be able to do this.

__If you want music__ you should be using https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=184405253028970496&scope=bot to get the music bot. The two bots are currently separate.

## Music Commands
The music bot supports media from many sites and even supports playlists from sites like YouTube and Soundcloud. The bot will not be able to play songs blocked in France (usually from copyright infringements on YouTube).

## Adding music to the playlist
Adding music to the playlist is pretty simple. To start playing a song, simply use the ;;play command. Here are two examples:
```
;;play https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
;;play rick roll
```
You can either explicitly state the URL, or you can get the bot to search YouTube and give you some choices. Here's an example response:

```
Please select a video with the ';;play n' command:
1: Rick Astley - Never Gonna Give You Up (03:33)
2: YOUTUBERS REACT TO RICKROLL (Ep. #5) (09:20)
3: I Rick Roll My Entire Chemistry Class! (05:55)
4: The New Rick Roll! (04:26)
5: Melania Trump's RNC RICKROLL (00:19)
```

You can then choose your song with the `;;select <number>` command.

**Supported sites:**

* YouTube (streams hopefully coming soon)

* SoundCloud

* Bandcamp

* Twitch

* Vimeo

* Direct links to files, including streams. Not all formats supported.

* URLs pointing to .m3u and .pls can be used to start streams.

Let me know if you want other sites supported. 

## (Very) Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I play music with the bot?
Please read this fine manual. Specifically the part with the music commands.

### How do I add an entire playlist to the queue?
Simply link a playlist with the following syntax:

```
;;play <url-to-playlist>
```

### How do I restrict music commands to a specific channel or role?
The bot will only listen to music commands invoked in channels it can actually **write** to. Simply override it such that the music bot can only talk in the channels you want the bot to be usable from.

If you want to restrict the bot to a specific role, you can always just restrict the bot to a channel only accessible by a specific set of roles.

### How do I self host the bot?
FredBoat was not originally written to be easily set up for selfhosting, but due to popular demand [I have written a tutorial.](http://docs.frederikam.com/selfhosting)

### The music bot is telling me it doesn't have permission to connect/play music. How do I give it permission?
You are trying to play music in a voice channel, but your __Discord server permissions__ prevents it from connecting or speaking. You would need to change the permissions of the channel to allow the bot to connect and speak, as you would do with a user. For official help on this topic, see [Discord's support center](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/206029707).

### Why is the bot stuttering?
The bot is sometimes under very heavy load, particularly around weekends. You can help me reduce the stuttering and bring the bot to more people by supporting me on my [Patreon campaign](https://www.patreon.com/fredboat).

### Why can't I hear the music bot, but other people can?
This is a Discord bug. Occasionally you may need to restart your Discord client before you can hear users and bots speaking in voice chat.

### The bot is saying I can't play a youtube video because it is blocked! How do I get around this?
FredBoat is currently hosted in the US, which means that any videos that YouTube blocks in the US are unavailable. There's currently no way around this, but we may set up an internal proxy.

### How do I get the bot to stay in my channel?
The bot will automatically leave a voice channel if it is left unused for too long. This is to improve performance of the bot, as leaving the bot idling in a few extra thousand voice channel takes a hit on the CPU.
