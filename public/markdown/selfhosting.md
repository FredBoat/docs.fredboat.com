# How to selfhost FredBoat
This tutorial is users who want to host their own bot running FredBoat. Bear in mind that this is not a requirement for using FredBoat, as I also host a public bot. This is merely for those of you who want to host your own.

#### This tutorial is for advanced users. If you can't figure out how to run this, please use the public FredBoat♪♪

## Intallation

### Requirements

1. [Java 8 JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)

2. git and maven in your PATH

3. [A registered Discord application](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token)

4. Linux \(Windows works too, but this tutorial is targetted at Linux\)

### Instructions
Clone the `master` branch of FredBoat recursively:

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Frederikam/FredBoat.git
```

Now compile the bot:

```sh
cd FredBoat/FredBoat
mvn package shade:shade
```

To run the bot you should set up a directory that looks like this:

```
├──FredBoat-1.0.jar
├──credentials.yaml
└──config.yaml
```

The compiled bot can be found in `FredBoat/FredBoat/target`. A sample `config.yaml` and an example `credentials.yaml` can be found in https://github.com/Frederikam/FredBoat/tree/master/FredBoat

In order to run the bot, you must first populate your bot with API credentials for Discord in the `credentials.yaml` file.

Music bot only: Fill in the Discord bot token for patron and at least one Youtube API key. Set patron to true in the `config.yaml` file and development to false.

Full bot: Fill in the Discord bot token for beta and every other setting too. Set development to true in the `config.yaml`.

Example credentials.yaml file:

```yaml
