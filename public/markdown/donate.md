# Help support FredBoat♪♪
FredBoat♪♪ has constantly been growing at a ridiculous rate ever since it launched. Building a bot of this scale has proven to be much more challenging than coding a simple music bot in the first place. Though by far the biggest challenge of this project is finding the money to provide enough server power.

It currently costs __over $200 per month__ just to rent servers, but even this will not be enough to sustain the tremendous growth and quality is also starting to suffer during the weekends.

## Perks of donating
As a patron of $2 or more per month you will gain access to FredBoat Patron in one server of your choosing. This comes with a few extra perks that we can't provide to the general public:

1. An isolated bot that is __not affected by peak usage__ (eg less lag)
2. The ability to __add Spotify playlists__ with tracks found on YouTube and Soundcloud
3. The __;;volume command__, which allows you to change the volume of the bot for everyone
4. Earn the __Patron role__ in FredBoat Hangout

## One-off donations
I also provide a PayPal donation link, __but I am unable to provide the patron bot to PayPal donators.__

Thank you for all your support!
