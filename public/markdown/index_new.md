# Welcome to FredBoat Documentation
FredBoat is an open-source general-purpose bot developed in Java. The bot is based off of [JDA](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA) and was created by [@Frederikam](https://github.com/Frederikam/).

Additionally I am also developing FredBoat♪♪ which is music bot. This is a seperate bot and must therefore be invited using [this link](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=184405253028970496&scope=bot). See the commands below on how to use it.

## Setting up the bot
Getting FredBoat running on your server is simple. You can invite the bot by authenticating it with your account using [this](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=168686772216135681&scope=bot) link. Bear in mind that you must have `Manage Server` permissions to be able to do this.

__If you want music__ you should be using https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=184405253028970496&scope=bot to get the music bot. The two bots are currently separate.
